# Who needs a README when you are a 1337 h4x0r?

Okay, but seriously... We probably should make one no matter how 1337 we may be :3

# Build
Something, something, CMake.

## Linux (1337)
Run the following in your preferred UNIX-like shell from the root directory :3
```
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++; cd build; make
```

## Windows
Good luck <3

## MacOS
Good luck <3
